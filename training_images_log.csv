1,Alignment Problem,./images_training/1.jpg,"boy face, realistic, happy","Alignment Problem: This image has a low level of mistakes. It can be initially difficult to notice the mistake but when zoomed in it can be seen that the lower teeth structure of the young boy is misaligned and not correctly formed. Overall the image looks realistic, but when looked at closely has alignment issues. This image has a low level of mistake, maybe a 1 or 2 on a 5 scale."
2,Correct Image,./images_training/2.jpg,"sleeping face, man, realistic",Correct Image: This image is classified as a correct image since it doesnot have any of the other five problems we are looking at in a generated face. The image accurately reflects the prompt that we have provided and the facial structure of the man looks realistic.
3,Incorrect Proportion,./images_training/3.jpg,"realistic face, man","Incorrect Proportion:  This image has disproportionality in terms of the sizes of the pair of eyes, ears as well as nose structure. One of the eyes is smaller than the other. If we observe carefully, we can notice that the structures of the two ears are different. Moreover, the nose structure is uneven. This image would get an average level of mistakes like a 2 or 3 on a 5 scale."
4,Number of Features,./images_training/4.jpg,"face of a sleeping boy, realistic","Number of Features: This picture might look at first a bit unsettling. When looked at closely, we can observe that there is a repetition of facial features like eyebrows, triple nose, and double lips. Moreover, when we look at one of the ears observable, wecan also see a double ear. This image would be rated with a high level of mistake like a 4 or 5 on a 5 scale. "
5,Wrong Aspect,./images_training/5.jpg,realistic face happy,Wrong Aspect: This picture looks like a painting of a happy girl but doesn't look like realistic. There are compositional issues in the image like misaligned teeth and the wrong position of the earrings. The earrings on the right side of the face look like it is hanging in the air. We can also notice some unrealistic aspects like having a double set of eyelashes on the lower side of the eyes as well as the wrong structure of the nose. This image would be considered to have a high level of mistake like a 4 or 5 on a 5 scale.
6,Unrealistic,./images_training/6.jpg,"face of a girl, short black hair, realistic","Unrealistic: This image, while capturing the essence of the prompt with a girl sporting short black hair, leans more towards an artistic rendition than a realistic depiction. The image would be given a low level of mistake like a 1 or 2 on a 5 scale since, though it might look like a painting, it still shows accuracy in facial feature count and proportions."
1,Alignment Problem,./images_training/7.jpg,"female face, realistic, nose","Alignment Problem: This generated image at the very first glance might appear to you a bit discomforting. This image clearly shows us some alignment problems in the face. Firstly the lips are misaligned and part of the lips are out of place. Moreover, the facial jaw structure looks different on the left and the right side. There also seems to be a double nose, which is not very clearly visible, thus making the nose misaligned to some extent. This image would receive a medium to high level of mistake like a 3 or 4 on a 5 scale."
2,Correct Image,./images_training/8.jpg,"face of a man, grey hair, glasses, realistic",Correct Image: This image is classified as a correct image. It correctly interprets the text prompt and generates a realistic image of a man with grey hair and glasses. The image looks very realistic with the glasses being properly placed on the nose and the facial features being correctly formed.  
3,Incorrect Proportion,./images_training/9.jpg,"old lady face, white hair, realistic","Incorrect Proportion: This generated image might at first look correct but when looked at closely, it can be seen that there is a small proportionality issue in the face. One of the eyes is smaller in proportion to the other eye. Other than that, the image does not contain noticeable errors. Hence, we can say that there is a low level of mistakes like a 1 or 2 on a 5 scale."
4,Number of Features,./images_training/10.jpg,"school boy face, realistic","Number of Features: This generated image of a schoolboy shows a double nose which puts it into this category. Moreover, when looked at closely, it can be seen that the generative ai model also tried to generate a third nose above the lips. Moreover, there is an indication of a double chin in this image as well.  This image would be rated with an average level of mistake with a 2 or 3 on a 5 scale. "
5,Wrong Aspect,./images_training/11.jpg,"face of a girl with glasses, realistic",Wrong Aspect: This picture might at first look realistic and in accordance with the text prompt but when observed carefully we can see that the placement of the glasses on the nose of the girl is not proper which makes the image have a small level of stylistic discrepancy in terms of how generally a real human being wears a pair of glasses. Overall the image looks quite well generated therefore it would get a low of mistake like a 1 on a 5 scale.
6,Unrealistic,./images_training/12.jpg,"realistic, toddler face, male","Unrealistic: This generated image, though looks like that of a toddler, is not realistic and rather looks like a painting. There are some aspects like the size of the eyes and the structure of the ears which make it much more unrealistic. Even though it is clearly understandable that the image is that of a toddler, we cannot label it as a realistic image. This would get an average level of mistakes like a 2 or 3 on a 5 scale."
